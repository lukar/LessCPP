# Added README

## Install

### Windows - Mingw
You will need Mingw with make and c++ compiler installed. Once in Mingw-cli you can install those using pacman.
```pacman -S make
pacman -S g++```
Download and place appropriate [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) on project-root directory.

As a workaround `make` should be called from PowerShell! (LSHIFT-right click...)
Make sure `obj` directory exists; it gets deleted by make clean.
```
c:\path\to\make\make.exe
```

Copy .dll files from `SFML-2.5.1/bin` to project-root folder.
Done.
